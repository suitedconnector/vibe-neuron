Flask-based AI neuron for Bittensor â€” serves AI voice agent and tool queries
Voice Agent Neuron for Bittensor
Description

This repository contains a Python neuron designed for Bittensor. It runs a Flask server that responds to AI queries about tools, resources, and voice agents. The neuron can be used locally or in a subnet.

It is lightweight, easy to extend, and does not require the private Vibe library.

Features

Serve AI tool recommendations via HTTP requests.

Query AI voice agents programmatically.

Fully local development; works on macOS, Linux, or Windows.

Flask-based for easy integration with other projects.

Python 3.9+

Flask

Requests (for querying the neuron)

Install dependencies:

pip install flask requests

Quick Start

Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>


Run the neuron:

python voice_agent_neuron.py
